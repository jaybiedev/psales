                So far, everything looks fine and should work. We'll only add some code for the event of a
                suddenly closed socket (e.g. when the client exits).What are we doing here exactly? At first,
                we check the server's State. Only if the socket is listening (sckListening) we call Accept
                and the connection is established. Remember to pass requestID to this procedure.
